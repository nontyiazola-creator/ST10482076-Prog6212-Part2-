# RaceDay API (Part 2: RESTful API Development)

A RESTful API for managing running, walking and cycling events, built with ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8), Entity Framework Core (Code-First) and SQL Server. It is the backend for the RaceDay system and follows the endpoint plan and ERD from Part 1.

**Demo video:** []

## Technologies

- ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8, C#)
- Entity Framework Core 8 (Code-First) with SQL Server
- Session-based authentication (server-side sessions)
- BCrypt for password hashing
- Swagger (Swashbuckle) for live API documentation
- xUnit with the EF Core in-memory provider for unit tests
- GitHub Actions for CI

## The two roles

**Organiser**
- Creates, updates and deletes their own events
- Defines categories (for example Under 20, Senior, 10km, 21km) for their events
- Views all enrolments for their own events
- Captures finish times and finishing positions
- Views and updates their own profile

**Participant**
- Views all events and their categories
- Enrols in an event by choosing a category
- Views their own enrolments and their own results
- Views and updates their own profile

Role is chosen at registration. Organiser-only endpoints return **403 Forbidden** to Participants and vice versa. Unauthenticated requests return **401 Unauthorized**.

## Authentication

- Passwords are hashed with BCrypt and never stored in plain text.
- On login, the user's ID and role are stored in a server-side session and a session cookie is issued.
- A custom `[SessionAuthorize]` filter protects every endpoint except register and login. `[SessionAuthorize("Organiser")]` restricts an endpoint to a single role.

## Setup and run instructions

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 with the ASP.NET and web development workload
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server (LocalDB, Express or full)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository and switch to the Part 2 branch:
```
   git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-REPO].git
   cd [YOUR-REPO]
   git checkout part2-api
```
2. Open `RaceDay.API.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Open `RaceDay.API/appsettings.json` and set the `ConnectionStrings:Default` value to point to your SQL Server instance.
4. Open **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**, set **Default project** to `RaceDay.API`, and run:
```
   Update-Database
```
   This creates the tables and seeds the two roles (Organiser = 1, Participant = 2).
5. Set `RaceDay.API` as the startup project and press **F5**.
6. Swagger UI opens in the browser. If it doesn't, add `/swagger` to the address.

### Trying it in Swagger
1. `POST /api/auth/register` to create an Organiser, then `POST /api/auth/login`.
2. `POST /api/events`, then `POST /api/events/{eventId}/categories`.
3. `POST /api/auth/logout`, then register and log in as a Participant.
4. `POST /api/enrolments` to enrol in the event.
5. Log in as the Organiser again and call `PUT /api/enrolments/{enrolmentId}/result` with a finish time like `"00:45:30"`.
6. Log in as the Participant and call `GET /api/results/mine`.

Swagger runs in the same browser, so it sends the session cookie automatically.

## Endpoints

| Area | Method and route | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/register` | Public |
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/login` | Public |
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/logout` | Logged in |
| Profile | `GET /api/profile` | Both roles |
| Profile | `PUT /api/profile` | Both roles |
| Events | `GET /api/events`, `GET /api/events/{id}` | Both roles |
| Events | `POST /api/events` | Organiser |
| Events | `PUT /api/events/{id}`, `DELETE /api/events/{id}` | Organiser (own events) |
| Categories | `GET /api/events/{eventId}/categories` | Both roles |
| Categories | `POST /api/events/{eventId}/categories` | Organiser (own events) |
| Categories | `PUT /api/categories/{id}`, `DELETE /api/categories/{id}` | Organiser (own events) |
| Enrolments | `POST /api/enrolments` | Participant |
| Enrolments | `GET /api/enrolments/mine` | Participant |
| Enrolments | `GET /api/events/{eventId}/enrolments` | Organiser (own events) |
| Results | `PUT /api/enrolments/{enrolmentId}/result` | Organiser (own events) |
| Results | `GET /api/events/{eventId}/results` | Organiser (own events) |
| Results | `GET /api/results/mine` | Participant |

## Project structure

```
RaceDay.API/
  Controllers/   Auth, Events, Categories, Enrolments, Results, Profile
  Data/          RaceDayContext (EF Core DbContext, seed data, constraints)
  Dtos/          Request models
  Filters/       SessionAuthorizeAttribute (login and role checks)
  Migrations/    EF Core Code-First migrations
  Models/        User, Role, Event, Category, Enrolment, Result
  Program.cs     Services, session, Swagger and middleware pipeline
RaceDay.API.Test/
  TestHelper.cs  Fake session and in-memory database helpers
  APITests.cs    Unit tests
```

## Unit tests

Run them in Visual Studio (**Test > Run All Tests**) or from the command line:

```
dotnet test
```

The 22 tests use an in-memory database, so no SQL Server is needed. Each area covers both success and failure cases:

- **Registration and login:** valid registration, password hashing, duplicate email, invalid role, valid login starts a session, wrong password is rejected
- **Event management:** create, invalid event type, update own event, update another Organiser's event (403), delete, delete a missing event (404)
- **Role-based access:** not logged in (401), Participant on an Organiser endpoint (403), Organiser on a Participant endpoint (403), correct role allowed, controllers carry the authorisation attribute
- **Event enrolments:** enrolment records participant, event and category, duplicate enrolment rejected, category from another event rejected, missing event, Organiser can view only their own event's enrolments

## Continuous integration

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`) restores, builds and runs all unit tests on every push.
